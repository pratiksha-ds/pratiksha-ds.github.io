## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://artistrynest.vercel.app//)

Artistry Nest is a minimalist e-commerce website specializing in modern home furniture. Built using Next.js, this project is a showcase of my front-end development skills, focusing on a clean design and a straightforward user experience.

Key Features:
* Inspired by a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1113372221049615805/e-commerce-website-interface-kit-design-system-completely-free), the website boasts a modern and minimalistic aesthetic, keeping the user experience at the forefront.
* The project was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a React framework, for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
* I used [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as the backend for product information storage, user authentication and storing user cookies.
* The website is deployed on vercel.

I started this project to challenge myself and see it through from concept to completion. While my primary focus is on front-end development, I believe in creating fully functional and polished projects.

### Built With

Next.js: Front-end framework for building React applications.<br/>
Supabase: Backend platform for user authentication, database management, and cookie storage.
